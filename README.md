**EasyInvest** is a web scrapping engine which selects the best potential start-ups for an interested investor.

Problem Statement - 
1. Create a social media and repository bot which indexes the potential startup ideas in a
database. ( Task 1 ) 
2. A news feed scraper must be used to trace the activities of the projects. ( Task 2 ) 
3. A CRM Style dashboard for the projects added to watch list. ( Task 3 ) 


System consists of following 3 main modules:
- The repository and social media bot to provide the investors about the informations about the startups.
- The CRM dashboard to show about the startups wishlisted by the investors
- The login page where the investor is logged in with us.


Note : The code was implemented in the Django framework with Mysql as the database. 
The data was web scraped using Selenium webdriver in Python.
Chatbot was implemented using Dialogflow and Firebase database. 
We also explored the LinkedIn Statistics API to scrape details from LinkedIn profiles of companies and founders of start-ups.
